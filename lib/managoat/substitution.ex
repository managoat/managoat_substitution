defmodule Managoat.Substitution do
  @moduledoc """
  `${VAR}` substitution over a nested config value.

  Most tools that read a config file take its strings literally and expand
  nothing, so a config that has to carry a secret or a per-deployment value
  is substituted eagerly, before it is written out. The escape exists for
  the rare consumer that does its own expansion and should see the reference
  intact.

      ${VAR}    eager — replaced from `vars`
      $${VAR}   escape — written through as the literal `${VAR}`
      $$        literal `$`

  Identifiers match `[A-Z_][A-Z0-9_]*` (UPPER_SNAKE_CASE), the shape
  environment variable names take.

  `apply/2` walks maps and lists recursively and rewrites string leaves only;
  every other value passes through untouched. Missing keys are collected
  across the whole value and returned together, so a caller sees every typo
  in one attempt rather than one per attempt, and a value with any missing
  key is returned unchanged rather than half-substituted.

  Fountain uses this at sandbox provision time for an agent's `mcp_servers`
  config, and the `fountain` CLI carries a Go implementation of the same
  syntax for apply-time substitution (`cli/internal/substitution` in the
  Fountain repository). The two are kept behaviourally aligned.

  Substitutes every `${VAR}` in `value` from `vars`.

  Returns `{:ok, substituted}`, or `{:error, {:missing_vars, names}}` with
